Beelink Photon2 hostname: photonvision  username: photonvision  password: photonvision
Beelink Photon1 hostname: photonvision  username: hackbots  password: hackbots3414

Both systems installed with Ubuntu 22.04.1
Both systems have PhotonVision installed
Both systems have the system network scan disabled
Boot time is about 1 minute
Both systems have net-tools installed in order to bring up ifconfig
Photonvision can be accessed using the ip adress then :5800

We need to set up a static ip adress for both Beelink systems.
PhotonVision has the team number set and is now looking for AprilTags on both systems.
